# Welcome to Stenomancer!

This is a typing tutor game meant to teach you the basics
of stenography with your qwerty keyboard.

The goal is to get you to navigate with N, S, E, W and use that
to walk around and pickup missing keys. Once you pick up a key
you will enter in a Bullethell to learn a new word with steno 
and finally you will enter a dialogue with the Stenomancer to
type up the missing word to complete your dialogue.
